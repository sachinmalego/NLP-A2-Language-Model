# NLP-A2-Language-Model
Language Model LSTM
This repository contains the implementation of a web application for exploring Language Modeling using LSTM in natural language processing.

## Overview
This application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with LSTM used text generation. Users can explore text generation and gain insights into these foundational NLP techniques.

## Features
- Interactive exploration of LSTM for Language Modeling and training.
- Text Generation visualization.
- Simple and intuitive web interface.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- VSCode or any preferred code editor

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the `app` folder:
   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages.

### Deployment
1. Open the `app` folder in VSCode or your preferred editor.
2. Open the terminal in your editor or use your system terminal.
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```
4. Note the local deployment address printed in the terminal, typically `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Testing the Application
1. Open your browser.
2. Enter the local deployment server address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
3. Interact with the web application to explore Word2Vec and GloVe functionalities.

## Usage
The web application allows you to:
- Visualize word embeddings.
- Analyze word similarities and relationships.
- Compare the performance of Word2Vec and GloVe models.

## Files and Directories
- `app/`: Contains the web application code and necessary files.
- `documents/`: Contains the pdf documents of the A2 assignment.
- `screenshots/`: Contains the screenshots and video of the working application.
- `datasets`: Contains the text repo of provided dataset
- For the `glove.6B.100d.txt` please download it from Kaggle or Google. It is readily available in the internet.
